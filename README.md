Readme

Description:
This program reads input from a file named "input.txt" containing a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer representing the length of a string followed by the characters of the string. The program constructs a linked list for each string, performs operations such as inserting characters, converting the linked list to a string, and then deallocates memory by deleting the linked list.

File Structure:

main.c: Contains the main code for the program.
input.txt: Input file containing test cases.
output.txt: Output file where the results will be printed.
